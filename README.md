Hi! My name is Stivenns and this is my portfolio, here you can see the knowledge I have and my work experience. I know it's not much, but I did it with the purpose of practicing React since it is the technology I want to focus on and although I have 4 years of experience as a frontend programmer working for a company that did not open its doors to framworks or technologies that could To give me better skills, I decided to start on my own and this portfolio is my first project as a frontend developer using React.

## Features

For complete development use the following packages:

#### [react-scroll:](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)

    To control navigation on the single page.

#### [devicons-react:](https://devicons-react.vercel.app/)

    In the skills section I show the icons of the technologies I am currently proficient in. I took the icons from this pack.

#### [react-hook-forms:](https://react-hook-form.com)

    I used this package to manipulate the contact form, from getting the information and adding each validation.

#### [EmailJS:](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)

    To connect the contact form and make sure that every time a message is sent to me, it arrives directly to my email. In the event that a failure occurs in the request, the user can send me another email with the same information already written just by clicking a button in an error message.

#### [react-hot-toast:](https://react-hot-toast.com/)

    When the form is submitted, I show an approval message or an error message if it fails. I show these messages within a toast that I created in a custom way with this package.

#### [tsparticles:](https://github.com/tsparticles/tsparticles)

    I thought it would be good to fill the background with a few particles as if they were stars moving around.

#### [framer-motion:](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

    the famous framer motion to give a little movement to the page.

#### [SCSS:](https://sass-lang.com/)

    I worked on the entire page style with SCSS.

#### [BEM:](https://getbem.com/)

    I like to work as orderly as possible and I consider the BEM methodology to be the best to work in this way, faster and more efficient.

## Lessons Learned

Above all, I learned a lot about React, from initializing a project from scratch, to adding packages and manipulating everything necessary with the right hooks, understanding when it is feasible to create your own hooks or your own code and when it is feasible to install packages. Work under the concept of having as a good practice not to insert a gallery in the public folder of the project.

It is my first project using SCSS and BEM, learning them I consider an extra point.

I practiced more about Git and GitHub, from creating the project and connecting it between GitHub and VSCode, to making pull requests and finally deploying the project to my own domain using Netlify.

It was a lot of learning and now with these strong foundations, I will continue creating projects and looking for a good job.
